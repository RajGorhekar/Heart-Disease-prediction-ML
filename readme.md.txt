# Heart Disease Prediction
Here , Machine Learning is Used to make predictions on whether a person is suffering from Heart Disease or not.
Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

=> K Neighbors Classifier :
classification score varies based on different values of neighbors , plotting a graph for different values of K (neighbors) shows Highest score.

=> Support Vector Classifier:
There are several kernels for Support Vector Classifier plotting a graph for different kernals shows best score.

=> Decision Tree Classifier:
Trying Different set of max_features helped to achieve best accuracy

=> Random Forest Classifier:
changing number of estimators and plotting a graph same shows best score.
