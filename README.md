- **K Neighbors Classifier** :
confidence score varies based on different values of neighbors , plotting a graph for different values of K (neighbors) shows Highest score.

- **Support Vector Classifier** :
plotting a graph for different kernels for Support Vector Classifier gives best score.

- **Decision Tree Classifier** :
Trying Different set of max_features helped to achieve best accuracy

- **Random Forest Classifier** :
changing number of estimators and plotting a graph for same shows best score.
